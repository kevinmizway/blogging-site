    <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am a 31 year old apsiring software developer that happens to love Corgis. I live in Cleveland, Ohio and I love it here although I'd have no problem relocating to any other part of the country. I live a childfree life and I have never been married. I enjoy going out with friends on the weekend.</p>

    <h3>Measurements and Diet</h3>
      <p>A Corgi should weight between 25-30 pounds.</p>
      <p>How much you should feed your Corgi depends on how they look each day. If you notice them a bit too chubby, feed them less!</p>
      <p>Apples or carrot slices are good options if your dog needs to lose weight.</p>
      <P>Obesity concern is extremely important with Corgis!</p>
